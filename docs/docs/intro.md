# Tutorial Intro

Let's get our **Slimy in less than 5 minutes**.

## Overview

The idea of this training is to introduce the basic concepts of React Native animations with the Reanimated 2 library in a fun way.

Let me introduce you to who will be our loyal companion throughout our journey. This is Slimy!

Slimy is a 150x150 View. As simple as that. Maybe some styles here and there, but in the end it is just a view, because the goal
of this training is to learn how to animate components that we'll use every day.
You can customize it however you want, color, border radius, whatever. Itâ€™ll be the base for our project.

We'll use the basic concepts of animations to bring Slimy to life.

## Getting Started

Get started by getting your own Slimy to build on.

### What you'll need

Slimy runs on an [Expo](https://expo.dev/) app.

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 18.0 or above.
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go) on your phone.
  - Otherwise, get an [iOS Simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
    or [Android Emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/) set up

### Generate a _Slimy app_

To get started, clone the repository and run the following commands:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

Then get [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go) on your phone and scan the QR code that appears on the terminal.
You can also run the app on a simulator.

You can now head into the next section to get started with the challenges!
