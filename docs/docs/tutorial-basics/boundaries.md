<summary>ðŸ’¡ TIPS && HINTS:</summary>

- You already have the gesture handler you need for this, consider using callbacks.
- The library provides us a [clamp](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/docs/utilities/clamp) function to bound the movement.
- You can explore the `withTiming` config for the bouncing.
