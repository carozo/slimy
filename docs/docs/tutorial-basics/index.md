# Tutorial â€” Basics

We'll organize the key concepts of animations in **five challenges**. These challenges were created to try and cover
most of the concepts you'll need to create any animation you'd like, but the animations presented in each one are not
very complicated. The idea is to use the challenges to learn and then be able to implement more logically complex
animations that use those same core concepts.

Go into the _My Slimy_ screen, open the `src/components/Slimy.tsx` file, and jump into the first challenge!
