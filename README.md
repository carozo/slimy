# Slimy
This is the animations training app for the React Native team at Xmartlabs.

# Overview
The idea of this training is to introduce the basic concepts of React Native animations with the Reanimated 2 library in a fun way. 

Let me introduce you to who will be our loyal companion throughout our journey. This is Slimy!

Slimy is a 150x150 view. As simple as that. Maybe some styles here and there, but in the end it is just a view, because the goal
of this training is to learn how to animate components that we'll use everyday.
You can customize it however you want, color, border radius, whatever. Itâ€™ll be the base for our project. 

We'll use the basic concepts of animations to bring Slimy to life.

# Challenges
We'll organize the key concepts of animations in five challenges. This challenges were created to try and cover most of the concepts
you'll need to create any animation you'd like, but the animations presented in each one are not very complicated. The idea is to use
the challenges to learn and then be able to implement more logically complex animations that use those same core concepts. 

CHALLENGE 1: Eyes wide open
Key concepts: Shared values, interpolation

I encourage everyone to try to put into action the Reanimated concepts and create their own creative animation!
